## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **NO MICROSERVICES REQUIRED:** All customer authentication now works locally with file-based storage
2. **PASSWORD SECURITY:** All passwords are hashed with bcrypt (PASSWORD_DEFAULT)
3. **CROSS-SITE LOGIN:** The 'crossuser' account works on both sites for testing
4. **CHAT FUNCTIONALITY:** Messages.php works locally, but chat.php may still reference microservices
5. **SESSION TIMEOUT:** Customer sessions last 24 hours by default
6. **ALL CREDENTIALS DOCUMENTED:** See JSON files for plaintext_password fields
